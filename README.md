# 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Three.js – 3D rendering and scene setup
- GSAP – Camera animations and transitions
- HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript – UI and interaction
- Responsive Web Design – Supports all screen sizes

# 🔧 How to Run the Project

3. Open `index.html` in any modern browser:
   - You can simply double-click `index.html`, or
   - Use a live server extension (VSCode recommended)

> No need to install Node.js or any build tools — it's pure HTML/CSS/JS.

# 📷 Demo Walkthrough
